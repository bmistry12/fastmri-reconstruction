    "The long acquisition time in fully sampled MRI leads to low patient throughput, problems with patient comfort and compliance, artefacts from patient motion, and high exam costs. Reducing acquisition time by under-sampling helps to mitigate these issues, but at the cost of reconstructed image quality. The aim of this machine learning task is to improve the viability of the more efficient under-sampling strategy by designing a system that maximises the quality of under sampled reconstructions.\n",

    "The MRI dataset provided contained raw k-space data from 100 3D volumes, each having approximately 30-40 2D slices. The data was split into training and testing sets with ratio 7:3 respectively. The training set contained only fully sampled k-space data from which ground truth and under-sampled data could be derived. The test set contained 4-fold and 8-fold under sampled k-space data as well as the 4-fold and 8-fold masks that generated this data."
